    "The exploratory analysis indicates that cruise passengers are most attracted to ports offering a combination of strong local attractions and specialized experiences, such as Boutique ports. Regions with higher visitor volumes, like the Southern and Eastern Caribbean, do not necessarily correlate with higher customer satisfaction, suggesting that passenger experience is more closely tied to port characteristics than to overall traffic. Ports classified as Major drive the highest shore spending, yet their satisfaction scores tend to be lower compared to Boutique and Private ports, highlighting a potential trade-off between economic gain and visitor experience. At the country level, smaller territories such as the British Virgin Islands and Grenada report the highest customer satisfaction scores, while larger markets like the Dominican Republic and Venezuela show noticeably lower ratings. Furthermore, the identification and correction of invalid data ensured that conclusions were based on consistent and realistic figures. The results suggest that enhancing local attractions and improving specialized experiences could be more effective strategies for ports aiming to increase both visitor satisfaction and economic impact. However, it is important to note that the dataset had some initial inconsistencies, including impossible values for several key variables, which required careful correction. In addition, not all region and port type combinations were represented, potentially limiting the generalizability of some findings across the broader Caribbean cruise market.\n",

    "Based on the data, Lobster Land should prioritize partnering with or operating in Boutique ports, as they consistently receive the highest customer satisfaction scores across all regions. Although Major ports attract higher spending per passenger, Boutique ports strike a balance between strong spending and a superior passenger experience—an important factor for brand positioning. The Bahamas and Eastern Caribbean also stand out as attractive regions due to high visitor volumes and strong satisfaction scores. Additionally, ports like Progreso and Port Antonio, with top local attractions scores, suggest strong tourism value and engagement opportunities. Focusing on high-satisfaction, mid-to-high-spend destinations will help Lobster Land deliver a premium yet enjoyable cruise experience from day one."
